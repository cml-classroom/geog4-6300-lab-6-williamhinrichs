# Geog4/6300: Lab 6

Complete the lab assignment by filling in the template. Knit it to a Github document and then push it up to the Github repo for this assignment. When you're ready to submit, go to the "issues" tab and create a new issue. Use the subject line "Lab 6 complete" and then put "@jshannon75" and your name in the body, along with any other comments you want to share about the assignment. Your grade will be entered below:

* Question 1: This works, though capitalizing sentences is a good thing.<p>
* Question 2: Good<p>
* Question 3: I'm not so sure on pop density--it's high in the SE where NDVI is also high?<p>
* Question 4: Downside of `lapply` here is that the models don't have the variables named. We had talked about `tidy` in `broom` earlier in the semester--could have been another option here. As a result your interpretation really suffers. Referring to variables by number doesn't tell us much, and you don't say anything about the magnitude of these coefficients or interpret them in light of the unit of measurement.<p>
* Question 5: Good<p>
* Question 6: A little better than Q4, but magnitude isn't just about number. Rainfall is measured in mm, so a one unit increase isn't very much. That's different from 1 degree C. Also, with significance, you can just say it is or isn't at a certain confidence level.<p>
* Question 7: Where are those extreme cases? The map can help you with this.<p>
* Question 8: This works<p>
* Question 9: This is a pretty generic interpretation--what are the important variables in your model? How are they predictive?<p>
* Challenge: This works.<p>

General feedback: Marked as incomplete for now--needs revision for Q4, Q6, and Q7.
